## Essential Linux Commands

### Running Linux

first install **Ubuntu**

`docker pull ubuntu` to get it from the docker-hub but if you run `docker run ubuntu` instead it's gonna run it if it finds it in local machine otherwise will pull it from the docker-hub

`docker ps` shows the running containers

`docker ps -a` shows all the containers stopped/running

`docker run -it imageName` to run a container and interact with it `-it` stands for interactive

to start ubuntu container in interactive mode `docker run -it ubuntu`

this is the shell `root@0c53e4ac76ca:/#`, `root` is the default user with the highest privileges, `@0c53e4ac76ca` is the machine id, `#` indicates that the current user is the **root** if you log-in as normal user that symbol will be `$`

`echo` prints whatever you put after it in the terminal

`echo $0` prints the location of bash or the shell

`history` prints all the recently used commands

`Note`: bash is case-sensitive

```terminal

root@0c53e4ac76ca:/#
root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# echo hello
hello
root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# echo $0
/bin/bash
root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# Echo $0
bash: Echo: command not found
root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# history
    1  echo hello
    2  echo $0
    3  Echo $0
    4  history

```

### Managing Packages

In Ubuntu we have `apt` which stands for **advanced package tool**

```terminal

root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# apt
apt 2.7.14 (amd64)
Usage: apt [options] command

apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for
searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.
It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools,
like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for
interactive use by default.

Most used commands:
  list - list packages based on package names
  search - search in package descriptions
  show - show package details
  install - install packages
  reinstall - reinstall packages
  remove - remove packages
  autoremove - automatically remove all unused packages
  update - update list of available packages
  upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
  full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
  edit-sources - edit the source information file
  satisfy - satisfy dependency strings

See apt(8) for more information about the available commands.
Configuration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).
Information about how to configure sources can be found in sources.list(5).
Package and version choices can be expressed via apt_preferences(5).
Security details are available in apt-secure(8).
                                        This APT has Super Cow Powers.
```

install a package `nano` which is a simple text-editor for commandline

```terminal
root@0c53e4ac76ca:/# apt install nano
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package nano
```

that is saying that the **nano** is not listed in the package-database of ubuntu, run `apt list` to see all the packages but not all the packages we need is listed there by default! that is when you run `apt update` to update the package-database. now you can install `nano`

### Linux File System

The Linux file system is structured in a hierarchical, tree-like directory format that organizes files and directories in a top-down approach, beginning from the root directory. Each directory can contain files and subdirectories, and it is designed to keep system and user data organized and accessible. Here are the key parts:

#### 1. **Root Directory (/)**

- The top level of the Linux file system, represented by a single forward slash (`/`).
- All other files and directories are contained within this root directory.

#### 2. **Key Directories in the Root**

- **/bin**: Essential command binaries needed for system operation, including basic commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mv`. These commands are necessary for both regular users and the root user.

- **/sbin**: System binaries, mainly for administrative commands (like `shutdown`, `reboot`, `fdisk`) that are typically restricted to the root user.

- **/usr**: Contains user binaries and programs. It's one of the largest directories and includes subdirectories like `/usr/bin` (user commands), `/usr/lib` (libraries), and `/usr/share` (shared files).

- **/home**: Contains directories for each user on the system. For example, if there’s a user named "alex", they would have a directory `/home/alex` for personal files and settings.

- **/var**: Stands for "variable" and stores data that frequently changes, such as log files (`/var/log`), spool files, and temporary files used by applications.

- **/etc**: Stores system configuration files and shell scripts used to boot and initialize system settings. Examples include network configuration files, user account details, and application settings.

- **/tmp**: Temporary files created by system processes or users. Data in this directory is often deleted upon reboot.

- **/dev**: Contains device files, which represent hardware components like hard drives (`/dev/sda`), USB drives, and other peripherals. Linux treats these devices as files, allowing you to interact with hardware through the file system.

- **/lib**: Essential shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

- **/proc**: A virtual file system providing runtime system information, like process details, CPU info, and memory usage. Files here are generated dynamically by the system.

- **/boot**: Contains bootloader-related files, like the kernel and initial ramdisk, necessary for booting the system.

- **/opt**: Used for optional, add-on software packages that are not part of the default installation. It’s often used for third-party applications.

- **/mnt and /media**: Directories for temporarily mounting filesystems, like USB drives or CD-ROMs. `/mnt` is a general-purpose mount point, while `/media` is typically used by desktops to auto-mount devices.

- **/root**: The home directory for the root (superuser) account, separate from other user directories.

#### 3. **File Types**

- **Regular files**: Normal files that store data, text, and code.
- **Directory files**: Containers for other files and directories.
- **Device files**: Represent hardware devices, allowing the system to interact with them as if they were files.
- **Symbolic links**: Shortcuts that point to other files or directories.
- **Sockets and Named Pipes**: Used for inter-process communication (IPC).

#### 4. **Permissions and Ownership**

- Each file has permissions for the owner, group, and others, defining read, write, and execute rights.
- Ownership includes both a user (owner) and a group, which is essential for access control and system security.

#### 5. **Mounting and Unmounting**

- External devices or partitions need to be "mounted" to be accessible within the Linux filesystem.
- The `mount` and `umount` commands are used to attach and detach filesystems to specific directories within the hierarchy.

Linux's structure may initially seem complex, but it is organized this way to make it logical, flexible, and powerful, especially for administrators managing various applications and services.

### Navigating the File System

`pwd` (print working directory) to see where we are in the file-system

`ls` (list) to list all the files and directories in the path you are shows all in multiple lines `ls -1` to list them in one line

The `ls -l` command in Linux lists files and directories in the current directory in **long format**. Each line in the output provides detailed information about a file or directory, organized into columns. Here’s what each part of the output represents:

```terminal
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group 4096 Nov  7 10:30 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user group  123 Nov  7 11:00 file.txt
```

`cd path/you/want/to/go` (change directory) changes directory to the absolute/relative path provided (absolute path always starts with /)

`cd ..` to go one level back `cd ../..` to go two levels back

`cd ~` to go to the **home** directory for normal users, the **root** user has a special home directory called **root**

### Manipulating Files and Directories

`mkdir` to create a new directory `mkdir myDirectory`

`touch` to create a new file `touch myFile.sh` to create a shell file or `touch test.txt`

`mv` to move or rename a file `mv oldName.txt newName.txt` or `mv prev/location/name.txt new/location/name.txt`

`rm` to remove files or directories `rm test.txt` remove test.txt file, `rm myDirectory -r` to remove a directory `-r` stands for **recursive**

## Editing and Viewing Files

use `nano` which is a basic text editor for terminal:

in the terminal run `nano` to run the editor, you can optionally give it a file name to open if exists otherwise create or cancel creation by pressing `Ctrl + x`

`cat` command (concatenation) used to view content of small files, for long files it's better to use `more` command to view the large file piece by piece also gives you a **percentage** of how much of the file has viewed, with `more` you can only scroll down by pressing `Enter` key.

`less` is a newer command to replace `more` thus might not be installed by default, first install `apt install less`, now you can view content of a long file and also be able to scroll up and down.

`head -n 5 file/path/test.txt` to get the first 5 lines from the **head/top** of the file,

`tail -n 5 file/path/test.txt` to get the last 5 lines from the **tail/bottom** of the file

## Redirection

In linux the standard **input** and **output** is **keyboard** and **terminal** but we can change it this is called **redirection**.

ex: when we use `cat file.txt` it reads the content of the **file.txt** and prints it on the **standard output** but we can change it using the **redirection operation** `>`.

`cat file.txt > file2.txt`, here we redirect the output of the **cat** command which to **file2.txt**

`cat` can also be used to combine the output of multiple files into one, as following:

create two files "numbers.txt" and "letters.txt":

```terminal

root@f637cef4b947:/# echo "1 2 3 4 5" > numbers.txt
root@f637cef4b947:/# cat numbers.txt
1 2 3 4 5
root@f637cef4b947:/# echo "a b c d e" > letters.txt
root@f637cef4b947:/# cat letters.txt
a b c d e

```

use **cat** and **>** to combine "numbers.txt" and "letters.txt"

```terminal

root@f637cef4b947:/# cat numbers.txt letters.txt > alphanumeric.txt
root@f637cef4b947:/# cat alphanumeric.txt
1 2 3 4 5
a b c d e

```

the **redirection** `>` is not limited to **cat** or **echo** you can use it along with other commands as well

```terminal
root@f637cef4b947:/# ls -l > longlist.txt
```

to store the result of long listing into longlist.txt file

`<` is the **redirection** operator for changing the **standard input**

**Note**: there might not be much use cases for this command

## Searching for Text

For searching a text in a file there is `grep` command **"Global Regular Expression Print"**, `grep options regex path/to/file.txt`.

1. searching in a single file:
   `grep -i hello hello.txt`
2. searching multiple files
   `grep -i hello file1.txt file2.txt`
3. searching multiple files using a pattern for the files
   `grep -i hello file*`
   **Note**: searching all files with their names starting with **file**
4. searching in a directory and all it's sub-directories
   `grep -i -r hello /path/to/dir`
   **Note**: `-r` is for **recursive** `-i` is for **case insensitive**

**Note**: In Linux you can combine options like this: `-i -r` into `-ir`

## Finding Files and Directories

The `find` command can be used for searching and finding files and directories.

`find` with no options/parameters returns all the files and directories in the current directory

`find path` `find /etc` finds/lists all the files and directories in the specified path

`find -type d` find all the directories, `d` stands for **directory**

`find -type f` find all the files, `f` stands for **file**

`find -type f -name "f*"` find all the files their names starting with **f**

`find /etc -type f -name "f*"` find all the files their names starting with **f** in **/etc** directory
`find /etc -type f -iname "f*"` the same as above but not case-sensitive

## Chaining Commands

In linux we can chain commands so you can wire multiple commands and run them in one go

`mkdir test ; cd test ; echo hello > text.txt ; echo Done` separate commands with `;`, if one of the commands in this chain fails to execute you would see the failure message but the rest of the will execute!

`mkdir test && cd test && echo hello > text.txt && echo Done` by separating commands with `&&` if one command fails to execute the rest won't be executed. the **and** operator.

`mkdir test || echo "Directory exists"` we can also use **or** operator to make a fail-save command chain,
if the left side executes with no problems the right side won't be executed but if the left side fails the right side command will execute.

we can also make command chains more readable by putting `;\` at the end of each command which takes us to a new-line, to finish the chain put `;` at the end of the last command

```terminal
mkdir /mydir;\
echo hello > test.txt;\
cd myDir;\
cat test.txt;
```

## Pipe

In the Linux command line, the `|` symbol, called a **pipe**, is used to pass the output of one command as the input to another command. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create command pipelines, chaining commands together to perform complex tasks.

### How it works:

1. The command on the left of the pipe (`|`) generates some output.
2. The command on the right of the pipe takes this output as its input.

### Common use cases:

1. **Filtering text with `grep`:**

   ```bash
   ls -l | grep "myfile"
   ```

   - The `ls -l` command lists files in long format.
   - The `grep "myfile"` filters the output to show only lines containing "myfile".

2. **Sorting data with `sort`:**

   ```bash
   cat data.txt | sort
   ```

   - The `cat data.txt` command outputs the contents of `data.txt`.
   - The `sort` command sorts the lines alphabetically.

3. **Counting lines, words, or characters with `wc`:**

   ```bash
   cat data.txt | wc -l
   ```

   - The `cat data.txt` command outputs the file content.
   - The `wc -l` counts the number of lines in the output.

4. **Paginating output with `less`:**

   ```bash
   ps aux | less
   ```

   - The `ps aux` command shows all running processes.
   - The `less` command allows you to view the output one screen at a time.

5. **Chaining multiple commands:**
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep error | sort | less
   ```
   - This finds all lines with "error" in the system log (`dmesg`), sorts them, and displays them in a scrollable view.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency:** You avoid creating temporary files for intermediate steps.
- **Modularity:** Commands can be combined in flexible ways to perform complex tasks.

## Environment Variables

### What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are key-value pairs used to store configuration data and settings for software applications. They are often defined outside the application code, making them accessible globally to the application without being hardcoded. They allow developers to manage settings like database credentials, API keys, ports, and other environment-specific details.

For example:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=supersecret
```

### Importance of Environment Variables

1. **Separation of Code and Configuration**  
   By using environment variables, configuration details like API keys or database URLs are not hardcoded into the source code. This separation makes code more portable and easier to maintain.

2. **Security**  
   Sensitive information such as passwords or API keys can be stored as environment variables rather than being included in the codebase. This minimizes the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data if the code is shared publicly.

3. **Flexibility**  
   Environment variables allow applications to behave differently in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) without changing the code. For instance:

   - **Development**: `DB_HOST=localhost`
   - **Production**: `DB_HOST=prod-db.example.com`

4. **Simplifies Deployment**  
   Using environment variables streamlines the deployment process. The same application code can run in multiple environments simply by changing the environment variable values.

5. **Ease of Updates**  
   Changing configuration values is as simple as updating environment variables, avoiding the need to modify and redeploy code.

6. **Prevents Configuration Drift**  
   Centralizing configuration settings in environment variables helps avoid inconsistencies across environments.

### Examples of Usage

to get a specific environment variable

```bash
printenv PATH # get PATH env using "printenv"

echo $PATH # get PATH env using "echo" but you need to prefix the variable with "$"
```

to set a specific environment variable

```bash
export  DB_USER=mostafa
```

usage:

```bash
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# export DB_USER=mostafa
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# echo $DB_USER
mostafa
```

**Note**: setting an environment variable this way it's only set and accessible in this current terminal session, if you close it and then come back it won't be accessible.

### Preserve Environment Variables

To preserve an env between different session you need to write it in a special file `~/.bashrc` which holds all user specific env files

`echo COLOR=red >> ~/.bashrc` and if you try accessing it right away it won't work `echo $COLOR` this will not show any output! the reason is ".bashrc" file is loaded only once when you log-in to your system, to solve it we can restart the session or reload the ".bashrc" file, `source ~/.bashrc` this command will reload the file and now `echo $COLOR` will return `red`

## Managing Processes

A process is a running instance of a program

to get all the running processes run `ps` in the terminal, you will get the following:

```bash
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   31 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

The output of the `ps` command lists the currently running processes in the shell environment. Here's what each column and entry indicates:

1. **PID (Process ID):**

   - **1**: This is the PID of the `bash` process, indicating the current shell session. PID 1 is the parent process in this context, as it is typically the first process in a container or system environment.
   - **31**: This is the PID of the `ps` command itself, which is running to produce this output.

2. **TTY (Terminal Type):**

   - **pts/0**: This indicates that both processes are running in the pseudo-terminal (PTY) `pts/0`, which is the terminal session you're interacting with.

3. **TIME:**

   - **00:00:00**: This shows the CPU time used by the process so far. Both processes have not consumed any noticeable CPU time.

4. **CMD (Command):**
   - **bash**: The `bash` process represents the shell you're interacting with.
   - **ps**: The `ps` command is the one being executed to list processes.

to pause the execution process run `sleep 3` you can change the amount of time

to put a process to the background just append `&` to the end of it like so `sleep 5 &` will put this process to the background and you will be brought back to bash to type your next command/s

```bash
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# sleep 30 &
[1] 38
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   38 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
   39 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

to stop a process run `kill 38` 38 here being the process-id you get by running `ps`

## Managing Users

### Commands

`useradd` for adding a new user

`usermod` for modifying a user

`userdel` for deleting a user

running each one of above with no options will return all the possible options which you can use and they are optional

### Crate a user

`useradd -m john` the created user is stored in a environment variable in `etc` directory `/etc/passwd`

`cat /etc/passwd` and the newly crated user must be at the bottom of this file

`john:x:1001:1001::/home/john:/bin/sh`

here we have multiple fields separated with `:`,

`x` is password which is stored somewhere else,

1001 is user-id,

the next 1001 is group-id,

`:/home/john` is the user's home directory,

`/bin/sh` is the shell program used when this user logs in

### Modify the user

`usermod -s /bin/bash john`, modify user, set shell to bash, for user john

if now you run `cat /etc/passwd` the shell part for the user **john** is changed `john:x:1001:1001::/home/john:/bin/bash`

passwords are stored in `/etc/shadow` which is only accessible to the root user `cat /etc/shadow` will show all the stored passwords in encrypted form.

### Loging as another user

`docker ps` to get running containers

```bash
PS D:\Courses\Docker\docker-learning> docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED        STATUS        PORTS     NAMES
e6e83e022ee4   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"   13 hours ago   Up 10 hours             modest_davinci
```

we want to execute a bash session inside this `ubuntu` container,

run `docker exec e6e83e022ee4 bash` or for interactive mode run `docker exec -it e6e83e022ee4 bash`

but with above docker commands we log-in as **root** user, for **john** run `docker exec -it -u john e6e83e022ee4 bash`

```bash
PS D:\Courses\Docker\docker-learning> docker exec -it -u john e6e83e022ee4 bash
john@e6e83e022ee4:/$
```

`$` shows that **john** is a regular user

**NOTE**: The **useradd** command is lower level and available on all Linux distributions. It requires additional parameters to set up the account entirely. The **adduser** command is higher level and not available on all Linux distributions. The command adds a user to the system with standard settings.

when working with docker we don't want to use **adduser** because it is interactive and we don't want that in our docker files.

## Managing Groups

Why to use groups?

Users in the same group have the same kind of permission/s

`groupadd` for adding a group
`groupmod` for modifying a group
`groupdel` for deleting a group

### Create a Group

`groupadd developers` create a group named developers

groups are stored in `/etc/group` at the end of this file your newly crated group must be

`developers:x:1002:`

### Add a User to a Group

`usermod` has `-g` for setting the primary group of the user, and `-G` for setting the supplementary group

**Note**:
Every Linux user has one **primary** group and zero or more **supplementary** groups
![groups](/groups.png)

if **john** is part of 5 groups and wants to create a new file (every file is owned and stored in only one group!) now which group should be used for this file!

that is why we need to have primary groups, primary group is automatically created when we create a new user with the same name as the user.

```bash
root@e6e83e022ee4:/# usermod -G developers john # add john to developers group

root@e6e83e022ee4:/# groups john # get the groups john is added to
john : john developers
```

#### Add a User to Multiple Groups

at one command `usermod -G groupOne, groupTwo, groupThree userName` `usermod -G developers, artists john`

one at a time `sudo usermod -aG group1 username` `usermod -aG developers, artists john`, `-aG` **-a** and **-G** are combined, `append group`

## File Permissions

File permissions in Linux define what actions users can perform on a file or directory. These permissions control access to files and directories for three distinct user categories: **owner**, **group**, and **others**.

---

### **Structure of File Permissions**

You can view file permissions using the `ls -l` command. Here’s an example output:

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 user group  1234 Nov 25 14:00 example.txt
```

#### Breakdown:

1. **File Type and Permissions (`-rw-r--r--`)**:

   - The first character indicates the file type:
     - `-`: Regular file
     - `d`: Directory
     - `l`: Symbolic link
     - `c`: Character device
     - `b`: Block device
   - The next 9 characters are divided into three groups of 3:
     - **`rw-`**: Owner's permissions
     - **`r--`**: Group's permissions
     - **`r--`**: Others' permissions

2. **Number of Links (`1`)**: Number of hard links to the file.

3. **Owner (`user`)**: The username of the file's owner.

4. **Group (`group`)**: The group assigned to the file.

5. **Size (`1234`)**: File size in bytes.

6. **Timestamp (`Nov 25 14:00`)**: Last modification date and time.

7. **Name (`example.txt`)**: The name of the file.

---

### **Permission Components**

Each permission group (`rwx`) is explained as:

- **r (read)**: Allows reading the file's contents or listing a directory's contents.
- **w (write)**: Allows modifying the file's contents or creating/deleting files in a directory.
- **x (execute)**: Allows running the file as a program or accessing a directory.

#### Example:

- `rw-` = Read (✔), Write (✔), Execute (✘)

---

### **User Categories**

1. **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
2. **Group**: Other users in the file's assigned group.
3. **Others**: All other users.

#### Example:

For `-rw-r--r--`:

- Owner can **read and write**.
- Group can **read only**.
- Others can **read only**.

---

### **Changing Permissions**

You can modify permissions using the `chmod` command.

#### Symbolic Mode:

- **Add**: `chmod u+w filename` (Add write permission for owner)
- **Remove**: `chmod g-r filename` (Remove read permission for group)
- **Set Exact**: `chmod o=rx filename` (Set others' permissions to read and execute only)

#### Numeric (Octal) Mode:

Each permission is represented by a number:

- `r = 4`, `w = 2`, `x = 1`, `- = 0`

Combine numbers for each group:

- `7` = `rwx`
- `6` = `rw-`
- `5` = `r-x`
- `4` = `r--`

Command:

```bash
chmod 754 filename
```

#### Example:

- **Owner**: `7` = `rwx`
- **Group**: `5` = `r-x`
- **Others**: `4` = `r--`

---

### **Changing Ownership**

Use the `chown` and `chgrp` commands:

- Change owner: `sudo chown new_owner filename`
- Change group: `sudo chgrp new_group filename`

---

### Summary Table of Permissions:

| Permission  | Owner | Group | Others |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| `rwx------` | ✔     | ✘     | ✘      |
| `rwxr-x---` | ✔     | ✔     | ✘      |
| `rw-r--r--` | ✔     | ✔     | ✔      |
